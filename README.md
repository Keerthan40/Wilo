Done as a part of an independent project under the guidance of Prof. Gajendranath
Chaudhury. A modifed version of EPC Gen-2 protocol was implemented to establish communication between multiple tags
and the reader. This is used in warehouses where multiple containers have tags. The tags correspondingly establish a
communication with the reader and give various information about the temperature/ weight etc. The communication was
implemented as a part of the IDP using Python-2
